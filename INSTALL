1. Requirements
----------------

NDPMon is written in C, which is why you need a C compiler. During the 
implementation, we used GCC version 4.1

Besides the classic system libraries, other additional libraries are 
required:
    * libxml2
    * libpcap

Make sure you have these libraries and the associated headers installed.

2. Installation
----------------

If you have troubles with the configure script, regenerate it with the 
command:

autoconf

To compile and install NDPMon, simply use the command:

./configure && make && make install

To uninstall it, use:

make uninstall

Note that the install and uninstall targets require root privileges.

3. Running NDPMon
-----------------

Before running NDPMon, make sure to edit the configuration file
/usr/local/ndpmon/config_ndpmon.xml to adapt it to your network.

To run NDPMon, use as root:

/etc/init.d/ndpmon start

To stop NDPMon, use as root:

/etc/init.d/ndpmon stop
