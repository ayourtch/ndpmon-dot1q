NDPMon, Neighbor Discovery Monitor, is a tool working with ICMPv6 packets.
NDPMon observes the local network to see if nodes using neighbor discovery
messages behave properly. When it detects a suspicious Neighbor Discovery
message, it notifies the administrator by writing in the syslog and in 
some cases by sending an email report.

NDPMon is an equivalent of ArpWatch for IPv6 and was developped during the 
summer 2006 by Thibault Cholez for the MADYNES Project from the LORIA - 
INRIA Lorraine. It is currently maintained within the MADYNES Project by 
Frederic Beck.
